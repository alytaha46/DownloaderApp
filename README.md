# Loading Status Android App

Loading Status is an app to download a file from the Internet by clicking on a custom-built button.

A notification will be sent once the download is complete. When a user clicks on the notification, the user lands on detail activity and the notification gets dismissed. In detail activity, the status of the download will be displayed and animated via MotionLayout upon opening the activity.
